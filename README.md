# Web Scraping: Qoutes and Authors

My very first attempt to delve into web scraping and decided to use simple, shot-list from this website http://quotes.toscrape.com/

I had to transform that page into an easy to read exel file showcasing exactly the data i wanted. Results were exactly as predicted showing two columns, one for Qoutes and another for Authors.
